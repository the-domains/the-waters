# The Waters

Where love and music collide, you will find The Waters. An acoustic duo comprised of singer/songwriter Krystal Baker and guitarist Sturgis Waters based out of Phoenix, AZ, they bring a minimalist approach to progressive folk-rock music. Her haunting vocals combined with his colorful guitar melodies blend to create a fabric of intimate conversation. The modest and dynamic aspects of the duo create an authentic experience. Once compared to a more multi-dimensional yet similar vocal sound to that of Natalie Merchant, coupled by his reminiscent guitar stylings of Tim Reynolds, you will find a great combination of distinctive yet familiar sounds. Playing both their original songs as well as unique arrangements of other artists, their love of music is something we can all connect with.

Their most recent studio album "4321" has sold over 3000 copies since it's release in March 2011, and is available on iTunes.
